## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### ERD Overview
The ERD provides a visual representation of the database schema, showcasing the relationships between entities such as users, categories, products, and bills. It serves as a blueprint for designing and understanding the systemâ€™s database structure.

### ERD Diagram
*An ERD diagram showing the entities and relationships will be added here.*

## GUI

### Overview of GUI Components
The GUI is developed using Java JFrames in NetBeans, utilizing drag-and-drop features to create a user-friendly interface. It includes various components like buttons, text fields, labels, and tables for functionalities such as order management and sales tracking.

### Functionalities Provided by GUI
The GUI allows administrators to:
- Create user accounts.
- Manage orders efficiently.
- Navigate through menus and perform actions such as adding items to orders or generating sales reports.

### User Interaction Flows
The user interaction flow outlines how users move through different screens and interact with various elements to perform tasks such as:
- Creating accounts.
- Placing orders.
- Viewing sales data.
